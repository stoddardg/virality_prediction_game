<p class="instruction-text">What makes an image popular on Reddit? This game tests your ability to identify popularity on Reddit. </p>

<h2> Instructions </h2>

<p class="instruction-text"> You will see a series of pairs of images. Both pictures were posted to the same subreddit some time in 2014 or 2015. You will be asked one of two questions (or both):


<ol>

<li class="instruction-text"> "Which do you prefer?"

Just tell us which image you like better. There is no right or wrong answer. </li>

<br>
<li class="instruction-text"> "Which image received more upvotes on Reddit?"

We are asking you to guess the image that received a higher karma score when it was posted to Reddit. There is a right and a wrong answer for this question (and we'll tell you if you guessed correctly). </li>

</ol>

<h2> What's this all about? </h2>
<p class="about-text">

This game is part of ongoing research on popularity in social platforms. It is usually assumed that voting systems, like the one used on Reddit<sup>1</sup>, allow the "best" things to rise to the front page. However we don't know if this is actually true and there is a lot of interesting analysis which shows that things like the timing of your post has a large influence on its popularity<sup>2</sup>. 

So if factors that have nothing to do with the content of your post play a role in success, do voting systems really surface the best content? </p>

<p class="about-text">This game explores this question by seeing if people, especially ones who use Reddit, can predict which image received more upvotes on Reddit. If you can keep your guessing score above 50%, then maybe Reddit's voting system reliably surfaces the best content. If not, there might be more to the story.

<h2> Didn't I do this quiz already?</h2>
<p class="about-text">

You might have. The first iteration of the quiz was launched in late October 2015. We decided to create another, easier version because people were very bad at it the first time around. You can read more about that on this <a href="https://medium.com/@gregstod/guess-the-karma-2-0-82a224a691f3#.516ysj7p1">blog post </a>.
